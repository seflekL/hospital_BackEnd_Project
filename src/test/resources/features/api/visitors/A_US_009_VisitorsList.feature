Feature: As an administrator (admin) I should be able to access the Visitor List via API connection.

  Scenario Outline: When a GET request is sent to the /api/visitorsList endpoint with valid authorization information,
                    it should be verified that the status code returned is 200
                    and the message information in the response body is “Success”.

    * Api user sets "api/visitorsList" path parameters.
    * Api user sends a GET request so saves the returned response.
    * Api user verifies Status Code 200.
    * Api user verifies "message" information in the response body is "Success"
    * Api user verifies the information in response body for entry with specified <dataIndex> index, including "<source>", "<purpose>", "<name>", "<email>", "<note>", "<created_at>".

    Examples:
    | dataIndex | source   | purpose                                    | name      | email                    | note                             | created_at          |
